# Sentence Embeddings 15K

In here we have 14.5K sentence embeddings, these have been built from a merger of several sentence similarity datasets, all of which can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/brmson/dataset-sts).

The sentence embeddings have been built using the sentence-transformers library with the `bert-base-nli-mean-tokens` model.
